# firebasics

This is a very rudimentary webapp with no CSS or Front end framework just intended to learn a few core concepts of Firebase.

The live demo of this project is hosted at https://firebasics-9a56f.web.app/

Concepts learned: 
  - low level browser API functionality
  - Google authentication on Firebase
  - Firestore NoSQL Document-Oriented Database
